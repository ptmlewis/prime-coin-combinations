# 💰 Prime Coin Combinations

## 🧠 Overview
Determines the number of ways to pay a total amount using **prime-numbered coins**.  
Uses multiple dynamic programming techniques to solve the same combinatorial problem efficiently.

## ⚙️ Features
- Three DP variants (`get_combinations1`, `get_combinations2`, `get_combinations3`)  
- Handles different constraints (coin limits, order independence)  
- Prints results and computation time for comparison

## 🚀 Run
```bash
python prime_coin_combinations.py
```

## 🧩 Example Output
```
Amount = 10
Ways using primes [2,3,5,7] = 5
```
